```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## To Do
- see if age is a factor in colelctions being future
- see if dietary choice is factore in collections being future
- graph with responses about feelings
- nature connection score calculation
- nature connection link to choices around collecting
- summary data: Age, Gender, field of work and industry, how many kill insects
- summary graph of skills needed
- how many think that insects collections are the future/how many think we need alternatives
- q40 feel free to expand - not sure if word cloud or not - but need to mention DNA vs people that think specimens are needed

```{r library}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)# for plots
library(scales)#wrapping text in ggplot



```


```{r read csv}
data <- read.csv("data.csv")


```

## Figure 1: how important are collections?

```{r figure 1}

##Make labels on x axis shorter
q31_shorter <- data %>%
  mutate(Q31 = recode(Q31, 
                           "It doesn't matter if students have completed this assessment or not" 
                      = "It doesn't matter \n if students have completed \nthis assessment or not",
                      "It is a moderately important assessment"
                      = "It is a moderately \n important assessment",
                     "It is a very important assessment"
                     =    "It is a very \n important assessment"),
                        "NA"
                    = "No resp"
         )



ggplot(data, aes(x = Q31)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "aquamarine4", width = 0.5)+
  labs(
    x = "Importance of insect collections as assessments",
    y = "Number of respondents"
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = label_wrap(10))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_wrap(10), expand = c(0,0), breaks = c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10))+
  theme_classic()
```

## Is there an effect of age on importance of the collections as assessments? 
Based on Kruskall wallis, no.

```{r stuff on age}

#Summary of ages of people 

summary((as.numeric(data$Q46)))


#get the likert for q31 into an ordered number
data$q31_likert_num <- as.numeric(factor(
  data$Q31,
  levels = c(
    "It doesn't matter if students have completed this assessment or not", 
    "It is a moderately important assessment", 
    "It is a very important assessment"
  ),
  ordered = TRUE
))


#Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ) - vprrelation between age and importance of collections


data$q46_num <- as.numeric(data$Q46)
cor_test_age_importance<-cor.test(x=data$q46_num, y=data$q31_likert_num, method = 'spearman', use = "complete.obs")

cor_test_age_importance

### Kruskall wallis cause of issues with sample size (shouldnt really be significant)
krus_test_age_importance <- kruskal.test(data$q46_num ~ data$q31_likert_num, data = data)
krus_test_age_importance


```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
